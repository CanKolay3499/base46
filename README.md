## base46 theme plugin

#### Credits: [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/base46)

- This plugin's a whole re-write of Norcalli's and NvChad's plugin.

## Setup

```lua
use({
  'CanKolay3499/base46',
  config = function()
    local base46 = require('base46')
    base46.setup({ theme = 'rosepine' })
  end,
})
```

## Contribute for new themes

- go to base46/themes and add your file, ex: atheme.lua
```lua
local M = {}

M.base_30 = {
  -- some colors
}

M.base_16 = {
  -- some colors
}

M.type = "dark" -- this can be either dark or light

return M
```

## Understanding theme variables

- Read the following for base_16 variables https://github.com/chriskempson/base16/blob/master/styling.md

- Use a color lightening/darkening tool, such as this https://siduck.github.io/hex-tools/
- The following variables are for base_30

```lua
black = usually your theme bg
darker_black = 6% darker than black
black2 = 6% lighter than black

onebg = 10% lighter than black
oneb2 = 19% lighter than black
oneb3 = 27% lighter than black

grey = 40% lighter than black (the % here depends so choose the perfect grey!)
grey_fg = 10% lighter than grey
grey_fg2 = 20% lighter than grey
light_grey = 28% lighter than grey

baby_pink = 15% lighter than red or any babypink color you like!
line = 15% lighter than black

nord_blue = 13% darker than blue
sun = 8% lighter than yellow

lightbg = 13% lighter than statusline_bg
lightbg2 = 7% lighter than statusline_bg

folder_bg = blue color

(note: the above values are approximate values so its not compulsory that you have to use those exact numbers, test your themes)
```
